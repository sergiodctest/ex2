Breakable Flask


A simple vulnerable Flask application.

This can be used to test out and learn exploitation of common web application vulnerabilities. 

Originally written because I wanted a very simple, single page vulnerable app that I could quickly run up to perform exploitation checks against. 

A the moment, the following vulnerabilities are present:
* Python code injection
* Operating System command injection
* Python deserialisation of arbitrary data (pickle)
* XXE injection


New vulnerabilities may be added from time to time as I have need of them.
